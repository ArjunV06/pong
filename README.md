# pong
This project is a more advanced version of the classic *pong* game. It is created in Processing 3, using vscode extensions.
To run in the processing IDE, extract the downloaded zip file and file->open any of the files within the unzipped folder.  It should open the rest automatically.
To run in VSCode, first add processing to your system path, download the Processing extension on VSCode, and file->open folder the unzipped folder.  Alternatively just open the .java file in VSCode after downloading the appropriate JDK and runtime packages
