# pong
This project is a more advanced version of the classic *pong* game. It is created in Processing 3, using vscode extensions.  It utilizes acceleration and deceleration to enhance the gameplay *experience*.

For either of the following methods, make sure to rename the extracted file as well as the file within to "pong".  If you get an error, this is likely the cause.
To run in the processing IDE, extract the downloaded zip file and file->open any of the files within the unzipped folder.  It should open the rest automatically.
To run in VSCode, first add processing to your system path, download the Processing extension on VSCode, and file->open folder the unzipped folder.  Alternatively just open the .java file in VSCode after downloading the appropriate JDK and runtime packages
